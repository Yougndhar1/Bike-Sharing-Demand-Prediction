# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

**Project Summary**

The project titled Bike Sharing Demand Prediction focuses on predicting the hourly demand for bike rentals using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist bike-sharing operators in optimizing bike distribution and availability to improve user satisfaction and operational efficiency.

**Problem Statement**

The problem addressed in this project is the prediction of hourly bike rental demand. Accurate demand forecasting enables bike-sharing operators to manage their fleet proactively, reducing wait times and ensuring bikes are available when and where they are needed.

**Data Loading**

The dataset used for this project is loaded using pandas. The dataset contains various features such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, and categorical variables like season, holiday, and weather conditions, which are crucial for predicting bike rental demand.

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and feature selection. These steps ensure that the data is clean and suitable for model training. Techniques like SimpleImputer for missing values and OneHotEncoder for categorical encoding are used.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses are conducted using visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib to gain insights into the data distribution and feature interactions.

**Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering is carried out to create new features that may enhance model performance. For example, interaction terms between temperature and humidity are explored to capture more complex relationships. This step helps in improving the predictive power of the models.

**Model Building**

Multiple machine learning models are employed to predict bike rental demand. The models used include Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor. Each model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset to compare performance.

**Model Evaluation**

Model evaluation is conducted using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the models. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are also performed to optimize model performance.

**Model Selection**

Based on the evaluation metrics, the best-performing model is selected. Feature importance is analyzed using tools like SHAP values or permutation importance to understand which features significantly impact the prediction of bike rental demand.

**Conclusion**

The project concludes by summarizing the findings and the effectiveness of the predictive models. The best model provides a robust framework for forecasting bike rental demand, aiding bike-sharing operators in efficient fleet management. Future work could involve integrating real-time data and exploring advanced machine learning techniques.

**Future Work**

Future work suggestions include saving the best-performing model for deployment, loading the saved model to predict unseen data for a sanity check, and deploying the model on a live server for real user interaction. These steps ensure the practical application of the model in a real-world scenario.
